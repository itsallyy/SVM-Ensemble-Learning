# SVM-Ensemble-Learning
This project focuses on predicting bank customer deposits using various Machine Learning algorithms and Ensemble Learning techniques. The dataset includes over 11,000 records, divided into depositor and non-depositor groups. The workflow covers data preprocessing, feature extraction, outlier management, and dimensionality reduction using PCA. After optimization, PCA with three components achieved a 71.79% test accuracy using the Ensemble model, demonstrating improved performance and reduced overfitting.
